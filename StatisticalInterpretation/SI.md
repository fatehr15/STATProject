## 1. Skewness Analysis (Mean, Median, Mode)

Using the descriptive statistics computed in Phase B, we compare the mean, median, and mode for each city:

- **London**: Mean ≈ 12.42, Median = 12, Mode = 6  
- **Paris**: Mean = 13, Median = 13, Mode = 9  
- **Rome**: Mean ≈ 17.92, Median = 17.5, Mode = 10

For all three cities, the relationship between the measures of central tendency follows the same pattern:

> **Mean > Median > Mode**

This ordering indicates that the distributions are **positively skewed (right-skewed)**.

**Interpretation:**  
The positive skewness is caused by higher summer temperatures, which extend the right tail of each distribution. These extreme high values increase the mean more than the median, resulting in right-skewed temperature distributions.

## 2. Variability and Consistency (Boxplot and IQR)

The boxplot visualization and the interquartile range (IQR) values provide insight into the variability of temperatures:

- **London**: IQR ≈ 9 (smallest spread)  
- **Paris**: IQR ≈ 10 (moderate spread)  
- **Rome**: IQR ≈ 12 (largest spread)

**Interpretation:**  
London exhibits the smallest interquartile range, indicating that its monthly temperatures are more stable throughout the year. Rome shows the largest interquartile range, reflecting greater seasonal variability and more extreme temperature changes. Paris lies between the two cities in terms of variability.

## 3. Normality Assessment

The histogram, boxplot symmetry, and standard deviation were used to evaluate which city’s temperature distribution is closest to a normal distribution.

**Observation:**
- London’s histogram appears more symmetric.
- London has the smallest standard deviation.
- Rome shows the widest spread and stronger right tail.

**Conclusion:**  
Among the three cities, **London’s temperature distribution is the closest to a normal distribution**. Its values are more evenly distributed around the mean, with fewer extreme observations compared to Paris and Rome.

> Note: Since each city has only 12 observations (one per month), perfect normality cannot be expected. However, relative comparisons between cities remain statistically valid.

## 4. Seasonal Trend Analysis (Line Chart)

The line chart illustrates the monthly temperature evolution for London, Paris, and Rome.

**Interpretation:**  
All three cities exhibit a clear seasonal pattern, with minimum temperatures occurring during winter months and maximum temperatures during summer months. Rome consistently records higher temperatures throughout the year, while London remains the coolest city across all months. Paris shows intermediate behavior between the two.

## 5. Overall Conclusion

In conclusion, Rome has the highest average monthly temperature and the greatest variability, reflecting its warmer Mediterranean climate. London shows the most consistent temperatures and the smallest variability, while Paris occupies an intermediate position. All three temperature distributions are slightly positively skewed due to higher summer temperatures, with London being the closest to a normal distribution.
